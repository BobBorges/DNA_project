DNA Project
===========
This is a repo for the DNA project. Here I'm useing SR to automate spoken-language corpus building. This repo contains .eaf files for collaborators who already have the media files. 

I'm still experimenting with the SR â€“ accuracy is not good enough yet to move foreward. stay tuned...

Conventions used from batch_0003/20190411_02:
1. [--]
Used when speaker falters, breaks off a word/sentence or hesitates.
2. Interjections like um or uh are transcribed. They are spelled as “um” and “uh”. 
3. Codeswitches are transcribed as [codeswitch “name of language”] or sometimes [switch “name of language”]. 
For the sake of consistency I’ll try to use the exact same form from now (batch_0007) on and use [switch “name of language”]. The transcription of the codeswitch is in the Switch tier.
4. If I’m not sure what has been said I try to make a transcription and put in the notes what the words where that I was not sure about. 
5. If I really can’t understand which word(s) has/have been said, I put “…” in the transcription and put in the notes which part of the sentence I did not understand. 
6. I make a distinction between: “er”, “daar” and “d’r”. 
I try to be as consistent as I can be, but sometimes “er” and “d’r” are hard to distinguish. I will only transcribe the occurrences of which I’m really sure that they are pronounced as “d’r” as “d’r”. When it’s not very notable, I use “er” instead.
6. If there are two speakers, I put both their names in the Speaker_diarizartation tier.
7. [] 
Used when sound is switched off

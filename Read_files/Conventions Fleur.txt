Conventions used from batch_0003/20190411_02:
1. [--]
Used when speaker falters, breaks off a word/sentence or hesitates.
2. Interjections um or uh are transcribed, spelled as “um” and “uh”, 
3. Codeswitches are transcribed as [codeswitch (language)] or sometimes [switch language]. For the sake of consistency I’ll try to use exact same from now (batch_0007) on and use [switch language]. The transcription of the codeswitch is in the Switch tier.
4. If I’m not sure what has been said I try to make a transcription and put in the notes what the words where that I was not sure about. If I really can’t understand which word(s) has/have been said, I put “…” in the transcription and put in the notes which part of the sentence I did not understand. 
5. I make a distinction between: er, daar and d’r. 
I try to be as consistent as I can be, but sometimes er en d’r are hard to distinguish. Only the occurens of which I’m really sure that they are d’r I will transcribe them as d’r. When it’s not very notable, I use er instead.
6. If there are two speakers, I put both their names in the Speaker_diarizartation tier.
